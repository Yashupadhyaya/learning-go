Scenario 1: Normal Operation of Pascal Triangle

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the correct computation of Pascal's triangle for a regular input, such as 5. The expected outcome should be a 2D slice containing the first five rows of Pascal's triangle.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as there is no external data required for the test.
  Act: Invoke the pascalTriangle function with the parameter 5.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned 2D slice matches the first five rows of Pascal's triangle.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected output of the Pascal triangle for an input of 5. The test is important to ensure that the function behaves correctly under normal conditions and returns the expected result.

Scenario 2: Pascal Triangle with Height 0

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to verify that the function correctly handles an edge case where the height of the Pascal triangle is 0. The expected outcome is an empty 2D slice.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as there is no external data required for the test.
  Act: Invoke the pascalTriangle function with the parameter 0.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned 2D slice is empty.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function when the height is 0. The test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles edge cases and does not produce an error.

Scenario 3: Pascal Triangle with Negative Height

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to verify that the function correctly handles an edge case where the height of the Pascal triangle is negative. The expected outcome is an empty 2D slice.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as there is no external data required for the test.
  Act: Invoke the pascalTriangle function with a negative parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned 2D slice is empty.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function when the height is negative. The test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles edge cases and does not produce an error.

Scenario 4: Pascal Triangle with Large Height

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function can handle large inputs and still produce the correct output. The expected outcome is a 2D slice containing the first 1000 rows of Pascal's triangle.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as there is no external data required for the test.
  Act: Invoke the pascalTriangle function with the parameter 1000.
  Assert: Due to the large size of the output, it might not be feasible to compare the entire output. Instead, check that the output is a 2D slice of the correct size.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected size of the output. The test is important to ensure that the function can handle large inputs without crashing or running out of memory.
