ROOST_METHOD_HASH=mod_77660bb85f
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=mod_10abfc4edf

Scenario 1: Testing with positive numbers

Details:
Description: This test will verify the function's behavior when both input parameters are positive integers. It checks the function's ability to calculate the modulus of two positive integers correctly.
Execution:
Arrange: No setup is required as the function takes two integers as parameters.
Act: Call the function with two positive integers.
Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the function returns the correct modulus.
Validation:
The assertion checks whether the function correctly calculates the modulus of two positive integers. This test is important because it verifies the function's basic functionality.

Scenario 2: Testing with negative numbers

Details:
Description: This test will verify the function's behavior when both input parameters are negative integers. It checks that the function correctly calculates the modulus when both numbers are negative.
Execution:
Arrange: No setup is required as the function takes two integers as parameters.
Act: Call the function with two negative integers.
Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the function returns the correct modulus.
Validation:
The assertion checks whether the function correctly calculates the modulus of two negative integers. This test is crucial because it verifies the function's ability to handle negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Testing with a positive number and a negative number

Details:
Description: This test will verify the function's behavior when one input parameter is a positive integer and the other is a negative integer. It checks that the function correctly calculates the modulus when the numbers are of differing signs.
Execution:
Arrange: No setup is required as the function takes two integers as parameters.
Act: Call the function with one positive integer and one negative integer.
Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the function returns the correct modulus.
Validation:
The assertion checks whether the function correctly calculates the modulus of a positive integer and a negative integer. This test is crucial because it verifies the function's ability to handle numbers of differing signs.

Scenario 4: Testing with zero

Details:
Description: This test will verify the function's behavior when either or both of the input parameters are zero. It checks that the function correctly calculates the modulus when one or both numbers are zero.
Execution:
Arrange: No setup is required as the function takes two integers as parameters.
Act: Call the function with zero as one or both of the parameters.
Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the function returns the correct modulus.
Validation:
The assertion checks whether the function correctly calculates the modulus when one or both numbers are zero. This test is crucial because it verifies the function's ability to handle zero as an input.
