Scenario 1: Testing with Prime Number

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies prime numbers. A prime number is a number that has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement necessary as the function does not depend on any state.
  Act: Invoke the function with a prime number, like 13.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns true.

Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly identifies prime numbers. The expected result is true because 13 is a prime number. The test ensures that the function correctly implements the mathematical definition of prime numbers.

Scenario 2: Testing with Non-Prime Number

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies non-prime numbers.

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement necessary as the function does not depend on any state.
  Act: Invoke the function with a non-prime number, like 16.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns false.

Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly identifies non-prime numbers. The expected result is false because 16 is not a prime number. The test ensures that the function correctly implements the mathematical definition of prime numbers.

Scenario 3: Testing with Negative Number

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles negative numbers. By definition, prime numbers are positive, so the function should return false for negative inputs.

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement necessary as the function does not depend on any state.
  Act: Invoke the function with a negative number, like -7.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns false.

Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly handles negative numbers. The expected result is false because there are no negative prime numbers. The test ensures that the function correctly implements the mathematical definition of prime numbers.

Scenario 4: Testing with Zero

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles zero as an input. By definition, prime numbers are positive, so the function should return false for zero.

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement necessary as the function does not depend on any state.
  Act: Invoke the function with zero.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns false.

Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly handles zero as an input. The expected result is false because zero is not a prime number. The test ensures that the function correctly implements the mathematical definition of prime numbers.
