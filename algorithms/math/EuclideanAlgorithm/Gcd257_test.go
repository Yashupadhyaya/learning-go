Scenario 1: Positive Integers GCD Test

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the GCD function with positive integer inputs. The GCD function should return the greatest common divisor of the two input integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the GCD function with two positive integers.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result matches the expected greatest common divisor.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the mathematical properties of the greatest common divisor. The importance of this test is to ensure that the GCD function correctly calculates the GCD of positive integers, which is a basic requirement of the function.

Scenario 2: Zero Integers GCD Test

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the GCD function when one of the inputs is zero. According to the mathematical property, the GCD of a non-zero number and zero is the non-zero number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the GCD function with one positive integer and zero.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is the non-zero integer.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the mathematical property of the greatest common divisor. The importance of this test is to ensure that the GCD function correctly handles the edge case when one of the inputs is zero.

Scenario 3: Negative Integers GCD Test

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the GCD function when the inputs are negative integers. The GCD function should return the positive greatest common divisor of the two inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the GCD function with two negative integers.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result matches the expected positive greatest common divisor.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the mathematical properties of the greatest common divisor. The importance of this test is to ensure that the GCD function correctly handles the edge case when the inputs are negative integers and returns a positive GCD.

Scenario 4: Same Integers GCD Test

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the GCD function when the inputs are the same. The GCD of two same numbers is the number itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the GCD function with two same integers.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is the same as the input integers.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the mathematical property of the greatest common divisor. The importance of this test is to ensure that the GCD function correctly handles the edge case when the inputs are the same integers.
