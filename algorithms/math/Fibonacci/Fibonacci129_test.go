ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=fibonacci_3c2494e9fa

Scenario 1: Test with a positive integer

Details:
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the fibonacci function returns the correct Fibonacci series value for a given positive integer. The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. 

Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the fibonacci function with a positive integer such as 5.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct Fibonacci series value.

Validation:
  The assertion is checking that the function returns the correct Fibonacci series value for the input. For example, the 5th number in the series is 5. This test is important as it verifies the basic functionality of the fibonacci function.

Scenario 2: Test with zero

Details:
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the fibonacci function returns the correct Fibonacci series value when the input is zero. In the Fibonacci series, the first number is zero.

Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the fibonacci function with zero.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns zero.

Validation:
  The assertion is checking that the function returns zero when the input is zero. This is the expected behavior as the first number in the Fibonacci series is zero. This test is important as it verifies that the fibonacci function handles the edge case of zero correctly.

Scenario 3: Test with a negative integer

Details:
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the fibonacci function handles negative integers correctly. The Fibonacci series is undefined for negative integers, so the expected behavior is not defined.

Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the fibonacci function with a negative integer such as -5.
  Assert: The assertion for this test depends on how the fibonacci function is expected to handle negative integers. One option is for the function to return zero, another is for it to return an error.

Validation:
  The assertion is checking that the function handles negative integers in the expected manner. This test is important as it verifies that the fibonacci function handles the edge case of negative integers correctly.
