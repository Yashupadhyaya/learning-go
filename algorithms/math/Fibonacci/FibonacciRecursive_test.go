Scenario 1: Fibonacci Recursive for n=0
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the FibonacciRecursive function when the input parameter is 0. According to the Fibonacci sequence, the result should be 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the function does not depend on any external data.
  Act: Call the FibonacciRecursive function with parameter 0.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result matches the expected outcome which is 0.
Validation:
  The assertion is straightforward as the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0. This test is important to ensure that the function handles the edge case of n=0 correctly.

Scenario 2: Fibonacci Recursive for n=1
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the FibonacciRecursive function when the input parameter is 1. According to the Fibonacci sequence, the result should be 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the function does not depend on any external data.
  Act: Call the FibonacciRecursive function with parameter 1.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result matches the expected outcome which is 1.
Validation:
  The assertion is straightforward as the Fibonacci sequence's second number is 1. This test is important to ensure that the function handles the edge case of n=1 correctly.

Scenario 3: Fibonacci Recursive for n=5
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the FibonacciRecursive function when the input parameter is 5. According to the Fibonacci sequence, the result should be 5.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the function does not depend on any external data.
  Act: Call the FibonacciRecursive function with parameter 5.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result matches the expected outcome which is 5.
Validation:
  The assertion is straightforward as the Fibonacci sequence's fifth number is 5. This test is important to ensure that the function handles the common case correctly and returns the correct Fibonacci number.

Scenario 4: Fibonacci Recursive for Negative Integers
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the FibonacciRecursive function when the input parameter is a negative integer. The function should return the input number as it is.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the function does not depend on any external data.
  Act: Call the FibonacciRecursive function with a negative parameter, e.g., -5.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result matches the expected outcome which is the negative input number itself.
Validation:
  The assertion is straightforward as the Fibonacci sequence is not defined for negative numbers. This test is important to ensure that the function handles edge cases of negative numbers correctly.
