Scenario 1: Fibonacci Recursive for n=0
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the FibonacciRecursive function when the input parameter is 0. According to the Fibonacci sequence, the result should be 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the function does not depend on any external data.
  Act: Call the FibonacciRecursive function with parameter 0.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result matches the expected outcome which is 0.
Validation:
  The assertion is straightforward as the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0. This test is important to ensure that the function handles edge cases correctly.

Scenario 2: Fibonacci Recursive for n=1
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the FibonacciRecursive function when the input parameter is 1. According to the Fibonacci sequence, the result should be 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the function does not depend on any external data.
  Act: Call the FibonacciRecursive function with parameter 1.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result matches the expected outcome which is 1.
Validation:
  The assertion is straightforward as the Fibonacci sequence's second number is 1. This test is important to ensure that the function handles edge cases correctly.

Scenario 3: Fibonacci Recursive for n>1
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the FibonacciRecursive function when the input parameter is greater than 1. The result should be the n-th number in the Fibonacci sequence.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the function does not depend on any external data.
  Act: Call the FibonacciRecursive function with a parameter greater than 1.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result matches the expected outcome which is the n-th number in the Fibonacci sequence.
Validation:
  The assertion is based on the definition of the Fibonacci sequence. This test is important to ensure that the function calculates the Fibonacci sequence correctly.

Scenario 4: Fibonacci Recursive for n<0
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the FibonacciRecursive function when the input parameter is less than 0. The function does not handle negative numbers, so it should return the number itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as the function does not depend on any external data.
  Act: Call the FibonacciRecursive function with a parameter less than 0.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result matches the expected outcome which is the number itself.
Validation:
  The assertion is based on the function's implementation. This test is important to ensure that the function handles invalid inputs correctly.
