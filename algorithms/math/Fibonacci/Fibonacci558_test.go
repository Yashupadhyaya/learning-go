Scenario 1: Test with a positive integer

Details:
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the fibonacci function returns the correct Fibonacci series value for a given positive integer. The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. 

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as we are directly feeding in integers.
  Act: Call the fibonacci function with a positive integer, for example, fibonacci(5).
  Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to check that the returned value matches the expected Fibonacci series value. The expected return value for fibonacci(5) is 5.

Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly calculates the Fibonacci series value for a given positive integer. This test is important as it verifies the core functionality of the fibonacci function with typical input values.

Scenario 2: Test with zero

Details:
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the fibonacci function returns the correct Fibonacci series value when the input is zero. 

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as we are directly feeding in integers.
  Act: Call the fibonacci function with zero, for example, fibonacci(0).
  Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to check that the returned value is zero, as the Fibonacci series starts with 0.

Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly handles the edge case of zero as an input. This test is important as it verifies the function's behavior with edge case input values.

Scenario 3: Test with negative integers

Details:
  Description: This test is designed to check the behavior of the fibonacci function when the input is a negative integer. As Fibonacci is not defined for negative integers, the expected behavior in this case is undefined.

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as we are directly feeding in integers.
  Act: Call the fibonacci function with a negative integer, for example, fibonacci(-3).
  Assert: As the behavior is undefined for negative integers, we can either expect it to return a zero (if the function is designed to return zero for invalid inputs) or we can expect a panic.

Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly handles invalid input values. This test is important as it verifies the function's behavior with invalid input values and error handling.

Scenario 4: Test with a large positive integer

Details:
  Description: This test is designed to check the behavior of the fibonacci function when the input is a large positive integer. The expected behavior in this case is to return the correct Fibonacci series value without any overflow errors.

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as we are directly feeding in integers.
  Act: Call the fibonacci function with a large positive integer, for example, fibonacci(1000).
  Assert: Use the Go testing facilities to check that the returned value is correct, and no overflow errors occurred.

Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly handles large positive integers without any overflow errors. This test is important as it verifies the function's behavior with large input values and the efficiency of the function.
