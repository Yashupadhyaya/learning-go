Scenario 1: Test with a positive integer
Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly returns a slice of Fibonacci sequence of the given length.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call fibonacciSequence with a positive integer, say 7.
  Assert: Check if the return slice equals to [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].
Validation:
  The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. So, we expect the first 8 numbers to be [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].
  This test is important to validate that the function works correctly with a normal input.

Scenario 2: Test with zero
Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles the edge case where the input is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call fibonacciSequence with 0.
  Assert: Check if the return slice equals to [0].
Validation:
  The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0, so when the input is 0, the function should return a slice with only one element: 0.
  This test is important to ensure that the function handles this edge case correctly.

Scenario 3: Test with a negative integer
Details:
  Description: This test checks how the function handles negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call fibonacciSequence with a negative integer, say -5.
  Assert: Check if the return slice is empty.
Validation:
  The Fibonacci sequence is defined for non-negative integers. Therefore, when the input is a negative integer, the function should return an empty slice.
  This test is important to ensure that the function handles this error case correctly.

Scenario 4: Test with a large integer
Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function can handle large inputs without running out of memory or taking too long.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call fibonacciSequence with a large integer, say 1000.
  Assert: Check if the function returns without error.
Validation:
  It's not practical to check the correctness of the output for large inputs. Instead, we just want to make sure that the function can handle large inputs without crashing or taking too long.
  This test is important to check the performance and robustness of the function.
