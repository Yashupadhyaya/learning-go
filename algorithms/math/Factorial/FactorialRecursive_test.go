Scenario 1: Test with a positive integer
Details: 
  Description: The test is meant to check whether the function correctly calculates the factorial of a positive integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as we are not using any external data or dependencies.
  Act: Invoke the function with a positive integer, for example, 5.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to check if the output is equal to 120.
Validation: 
  The choice of assertion is straightforward because the factorial of 5 is 120. The test is important as it verifies the function's ability to correctly calculate the factorial of a positive integer.

Scenario 2: Test with zero
Details: 
  Description: This test checks whether the function correctly returns 1 when the input is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as we are not using any external data or dependencies.
  Act: Invoke the function with zero.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to check if the output is equal to 1.
Validation: 
  The choice of assertion is based on the mathematical fact that the factorial of zero is 1. This test is important as it verifies the function's ability to handle an edge case.

Scenario 3: Test with a negative integer
Details: 
  Description: This test is meant to check how the function behaves when provided with a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as we are not using any external data or dependencies.
  Act: Invoke the function with a negative integer, for example, -5.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to check if the output is correct. In this case, the function should ideally return an error or a specific value indicating an invalid operation, as factorials of negative numbers are undefined.
Validation: 
  The assertion is based on the fact that factorials of negative numbers are undefined. The function would ideally return an error or a specific value that indicates an invalid operation. This test is important as it checks how the function handles invalid inputs.
