Scenario 1: Calculating the factorial of a positive integer

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Factorial function when a positive integer is passed as an argument. The target scenario is the normal operation of the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the Factorial function with a positive integer (e.g., 5).
  Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the actual result matches the expected outcome (i.e., 120).
Validation:
  The assertion checks whether the function correctly calculates the factorial of a positive integer. The expected result is based on the mathematical definition of factorials. This test is crucial for ensuring that the function behaves as expected under normal operation.

Scenario 2: Calculating the factorial of zero

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Factorial function when zero is passed as an argument. The target scenario is an edge case where the function should return 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the Factorial function with zero.
  Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the actual result matches the expected outcome (i.e., 1).
Validation:
  The assertion checks whether the function correctly calculates the factorial of zero. The expected result is based on the mathematical definition of factorials. This test is important for ensuring that the function handles edge cases correctly.

Scenario 3: Calculating the factorial of a negative integer

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Factorial function when a negative integer is passed as an argument. The target scenario is an error handling case where the function should return 1 (since factorial is not defined for negative numbers).
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the Factorial function with a negative integer (e.g., -5).
  Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the actual result matches the expected outcome (i.e., 1).
Validation:
  The assertion checks whether the function correctly handles negative integers. The expected result is based on the mathematical definition of factorials. This test is crucial for ensuring that the function handles error cases correctly.
