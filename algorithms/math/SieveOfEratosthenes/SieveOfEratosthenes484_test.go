Scenario 1: Testing with a small positive number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the function when passed a small positive number, for example, 5. The function should return all prime numbers up to that number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as there are no dependencies.
  Act: Call the function sieveOfEratosthenes with the number 5.
  Assert: Assert that the returned slice is equal to [2, 3, 5].
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly returns all prime numbers up to the input number. This test is important to ensure the function works correctly with basic inputs.

Scenario 2: Testing with a larger positive number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the function when passed a larger positive number, for example, 30. The function should return all prime numbers up to that number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as there are no dependencies.
  Act: Call the function sieveOfEratosthenes with the number 30.
  Assert: Assert that the returned slice is equal to [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29].
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly returns all prime numbers up to the input number. This test is important to ensure the function works correctly with larger inputs.

Scenario 3: Testing with negative number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the function when passed a negative number. The function should return an empty slice since there are no prime numbers less than 2.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as there are no dependencies.
  Act: Call the function sieveOfEratosthenes with a negative number, for example, -5.
  Assert: Assert that the returned slice is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly handles negative input by returning an empty slice. This test is important to ensure the function handles edge cases correctly.

Scenario 4: Testing with zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the function when passed zero. The function should return an empty slice since there are no prime numbers less than 2.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as there are no dependencies.
  Act: Call the function sieveOfEratosthenes with zero.
  Assert: Assert that the returned slice is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly handles zero input by returning an empty slice. This test is important to ensure the function handles edge cases correctly.

Scenario 5: Testing with one

Details:
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the function when passed one. The function should return an empty slice since there are no prime numbers less than 2.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as there are no dependencies.
  Act: Call the function sieveOfEratosthenes with one.
  Assert: Assert that the returned slice is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly handles input of one by returning an empty slice. This test is important to ensure the function handles edge cases correctly.
