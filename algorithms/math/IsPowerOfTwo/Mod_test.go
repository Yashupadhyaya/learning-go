ROOST_METHOD_HASH=mod_77660bb85f
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=mod_10abfc4edf

Scenario 1: Modulo Operation with Positive Integers

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the standard functionality of the mod function when both parameters are positive integers.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required.
    Act: Invoke the mod function with two positive integers.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify the result is as expected.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the mod function is working correctly with positive integers. The expected result is the remainder of the division of the first integer by the second one. This test is important to ensure that the mod function works correctly under normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Modulo Operation with Negative Integers

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the mod function when both parameters are negative integers.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required.
    Act: Invoke the mod function with two negative integers.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify the result is as expected.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the mod function is working correctly with negative integers. The expected result is the remainder of the division of the first integer by the second one, subtracted from the second integer. This test is important to ensure that the mod function works correctly with negative inputs.

Scenario 3: Modulo Operation with Mixed Integers

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the mod function when the parameters are a mix of positive and negative integers.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required.
    Act: Invoke the mod function with a positive integer and a negative integer.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify the result is as expected.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the mod function is working correctly with mixed integers. The expected result is the remainder of the division of the first integer by the second one, added to the second integer if the first integer is negative. This test is important to ensure that the mod function works correctly with mixed inputs.

Scenario 4: Modulo Operation with Zero

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the mod function when one of the parameters is zero.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required.
    Act: Invoke the mod function with a non-zero integer and zero.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify the result is as expected.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the mod function is working correctly with zero as an input. The expected result is undefined since division by zero is not defined in mathematics. This test is important to ensure that the mod function handles division by zero gracefully.
