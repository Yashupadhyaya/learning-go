ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=mod_10abfc4edf

Scenario 1: Modulo Operation with Positive Integers

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the standard functionality of the mod function when both parameters are positive integers.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required.
    Act: Invoke the mod function with two positive integers.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify the result is as expected.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the mod function is working as expected for positive integers. This is important as it verifies the basic functionality of the function.

Scenario 2: Modulo Operation with Negative Integers

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the mod function when both parameters are negative integers.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required.
    Act: Invoke the mod function with two negative integers.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify the result is as expected.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the mod function is working as expected for negative integers. This is important to ensure the function can handle negative values correctly.

Scenario 3: Modulo Operation with Positive and Negative Integer

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the mod function when one parameter is a positive integer and the other is a negative integer.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required.
    Act: Invoke the mod function with a positive integer and a negative integer.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify the result is as expected.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the mod function is working as expected for mixed sign integers. This is important to ensure the function can handle mixed sign values correctly.

Scenario 4: Modulo Operation with Zero

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the mod function when one of the parameters is zero.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required.
    Act: Invoke the mod function with a non-zero integer and zero.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify the result is as expected.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the mod function is working as expected when one of the parameters is zero. This is important as it verifies the function's handling of edge cases.

Scenario 5: Modulo Operation with Large Integers

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the mod function when both parameters are large integers.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required.
    Act: Invoke the mod function with two large integers.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify the result is as expected.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the mod function is working as expected for large integers. This is important to ensure the function can handle large values correctly.
