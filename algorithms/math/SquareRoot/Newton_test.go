Scenario 1: Testing Newton's method to find square root of positive numbers

Details:
  Description: This test will check the functionality of the "newton" function when the inputs are positive numbers. The test will verify if the function is correctly implementing Newton's method to calculate the square root of a number.
Execution:
  Arrange: The test will need to set up two float64 numbers, one for z and another for x, both of which are positive.
  Act: The test will invoke the "newton" function with the two float64 numbers as parameters.
  Assert: The test will use Go's testing facilities to check if the returned result is as expected, according to Newton's method.
Validation:
  The assertion will check if the returned value is correct based on the mathematical formula of Newton's method. This test is important to ensure that the function works correctly under normal conditions and returns the expected result when given positive numbers as input.

Scenario 2: Testing Newton's method when z is zero

Details:
  Description: This test will check the functionality of the "newton" function when z is zero. Since the denominator of the formula in the function becomes zero, it should return an error or infinity.
Execution:
  Arrange: The test will need to set up two float64 numbers, one for z which is zero and another for x which is a positive number.
  Act: The test will invoke the "newton" function with the two float64 numbers as parameters.
  Assert: The test will use Go's testing facilities to check if the returned result is an error or infinity.
Validation:
  The assertion will check if the returned value is an error or infinity. This test is important to ensure that the function handles the edge case of a zero denominator correctly.

Scenario 3: Testing Newton's method when x is zero

Details:
  Description: This test will check the functionality of the "newton" function when x is zero. Since the square root of zero is zero, the function should return zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: The test will need to set up two float64 numbers, one for z which is a positive number and another for x which is zero.
  Act: The test will invoke the "newton" function with the two float64 numbers as parameters.
  Assert: The test will use Go's testing facilities to check if the returned result is zero.
Validation:
  The assertion will check if the returned value is zero. This test is important to ensure that the function handles the edge case of a zero input correctly.

Scenario 4: Testing Newton's method with negative numbers

Details:
  Description: This test will check the functionality of the "newton" function when the inputs are negative numbers. Since the square root of a negative number is a complex number, the function should return an error or a complex number.
Execution:
  Arrange: The test will need to set up two float64 numbers, both of which are negative.
  Act: The test will invoke the "newton" function with the two float64 numbers as parameters.
  Assert: The test will use Go's testing facilities to check if the returned result is an error or a complex number.
Validation:
  The assertion will check if the returned value is an error or a complex number. This test is important to ensure that the function handles the edge case of negative numbers correctly.
