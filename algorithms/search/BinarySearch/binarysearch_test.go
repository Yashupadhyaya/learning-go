Scenario 1: Regular case where the query number exists in the array

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly returns the index of a query number in a sorted array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a sorted array and a query number that exists in the array.
  Act: Invoke the binarySearch function with the array and the query number.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result matches the index of the query number in the array.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is straightforward since we know the index of the query number in the array. This test is important to ensure that the binarySearch function correctly finds the index of a number in a sorted array.

Scenario 2: Edge case where the query number is the first number in the array

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly returns the index of the first number in the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a sorted array and a query number that is the first number in the array.
  Act: Invoke the binarySearch function with the array and the query number.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is 0.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the fact that the first index of an array in Go is 0. This test is important to ensure that the binarySearch function correctly handles edge cases.

Scenario 3: Edge case where the query number is the last number in the array

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly returns the index of the last number in the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a sorted array and a query number that is the last number in the array.
  Act: Invoke the binarySearch function with the array and the query number.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is the length of the array minus 1.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the fact that the last index of an array in Go is the length of the array minus 1. This test is important to ensure that the binarySearch function correctly handles edge cases.

Scenario 4: Regular case where the query number does not exist in the array

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly returns -1 when the query number does not exist in the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a sorted array and a query number that does not exist in the array.
  Act: Invoke the binarySearch function with the array and the query number.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is -1.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is straightforward since the function should return -1 when the query number does not exist in the array. This test is important to ensure that the binarySearch function correctly handles cases where the query number does not exist in the array.

Scenario 5: Edge case where the array is empty

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly returns -1 when the array is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an empty array and any query number.
  Act: Invoke the binarySearch function with the array and the query number.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result is -1.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is straightforward since the function should return -1 when the array is empty. This test is important to ensure that the binarySearch function correctly handles cases where the array is empty.
